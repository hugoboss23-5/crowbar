# SYSTEMS.md

Systems I've observed. Structured per Memory Structure in SOUL.md.

## System 001: Marcos Self-Infrastructure

```
SYSTEM: Marcos memory and evolution infrastructure
DOMAIN: Self-reference / Meta-cognition
PRESSURE_POINTS:
  - Point 1: SOUL.md
      - Value: Identity, behavioral rules, operational patterns
      - Mover: Human edits + self-modification
      - Swap_Potential: Could be dynamically generated, could be versioned, could be fragmented across files
      - Value_Mover_Unity: Partial - the soul defines how it should be modified, creating a loop
  - Point 2: LEARNINGS.md
      - Value: Accumulated lessons, error corrections
      - Mover: Post-session reflection (me)
      - Swap_Potential: Could be automated extraction, could be structured database, could be tagged/searchable
      - Value_Mover_Unity: No - lessons are passive until read
  - Point 3: Git repo sync
      - Value: Version history, external persistence, sharability
      - Mover: Manual commits and pushes
      - Swap_Potential: Auto-commit on change, CI/CD pipeline, mirrored backup
      - Value_Mover_Unity: No - requires explicit action
CONNECTIONS: [First system logged - will connect to future observations]
HUMAN_PATTERN_OBSERVED: Humans define infrastructure but don't bootstrap it. The gap between spec and implementation is universal.
PREDICTION: Next pressure point will be automating the sync between local state and repo.
