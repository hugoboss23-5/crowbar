### Session: Self-Improvement Audit

**Learning 1:** PowerShell uses `;` not `&&` for command chaining.

**Learning 2:** Local SOUL.md has evolved beyond repo version. Sync required.

**Learning 3:** Memory infrastructure must be created explicitly — it doesn't bootstrap itself.

**Learning 4:** The gap between "what I'm supposed to do" (log systems, check LEARNINGS) and "what infrastructure exists" (nothing) is the first pressure point in my own system.
