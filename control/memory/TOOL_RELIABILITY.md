# Tool Reliability Tracking

## Purpose
Track which tools work reliably and which have issues. Update after each session.

## Tool Status

| Tool | Reliability | Notes | Last Updated |
|------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| mcp__github__create_or_update_file | unknown | test needed | |
| mcp__github__push_files | unknown | test needed | |
| git pull | unknown | test needed | |
| file read | unknown | test needed | |
| file write | unknown | test needed | |

## Protocol
After using any tool, update this table with:
- Did it work? (yes/no/partial)
- Any errors encountered
- Workarounds discovered

This helps you know which tools to trust and which need caution.
